# Description

This is the implementation of the game described in the [roguebasin tutorial](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod).

Note that this is a work in progress, my first larger project written in Racket,
and the first game to write.
So the quality of the code is still lacking a bit and needs some refactoring.
